“I see nothing here, but a round thing made of
gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this
round thing belongs to him. So, what's all this
staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars,
that’s true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine
hundred and sixty cigars. I won't smoke dirty pipes
like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's nine hundred
and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ‘em out.
Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really
wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But,
avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before
he took to the sea.”
